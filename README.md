# SML & HOL Theorem Proving
This repository has my notes and code while learning **Standard ML (SML)** and the **HOL theorem prover**. I'm doing this to understand formal verification and logical reasoning using programming.

I’m learning SML (using the SML/NJ compiler) and HOL from the official site [https://hol-theorem-prover.org/](https://hol-theorem-prover.org/). I realized that it’s very hard to find beginner-friendly material on the internet for HOL and SML, so I’ve decided to collect everything in one place. It might help someone else who is trying to learn these tools too.

## Tools I'm Using

- [Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ)](https://www.smlnj.org/)
- [HOL Theorem Prover](https://hol-theorem-prover.org/)

## What’s Inside This Repo

- `sml/` — Code written while learning Standard ML
- `hol/` — Code and examples written inside the HOL theorem prover
- `notes/` — My notes to understand the ideas more clearly

## Resources
- *The HOL System Tutorial* (for HOL Trindemossen-1)
- *Notes on Programming: Standard ML of New Jersey (v110.0.6)* — by Riccardo Pucella, Cornell CS Dept.

## Why I Made This Public

I’m still new to formal methods, but I believe sharing learning journeys helps others and maybe others learning HOL or SML will benefit from this too.
