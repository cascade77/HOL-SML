- This repository has my notes and code while learning **Standard ML (SML)** and the **HOL theorem prover**. I'm doing this to understand formal verification and logical reasoning using programming.
  
- I’m learning SML (using the SML/NJ compiler) and HOL from the official site [https://hol-theorem-prover.org/](https://hol-theorem-prover.org/).
